# Measurements

Probe sources kept so a claim can be re-checked rather than re-argued. A measurement nobody can
re-run is barely better than a guess.

## `object-kind-selector-var-probe.al` — which AL object kinds can carry the selector var

Answers R40. `canCarryMutationSelectorVar` (`packages/schemata/src/compile.ts`) refuses every
object kind but codeunit and table, stating that no other kind can carry
`var MutationSelector: Codeunit "Mutation Selector";` and that a guard in one "cannot compile
(AL0118)". On Continia Document Output that refusal costs 41% of the app's mutation sites.

This probe declares that exact var inside a `page`, a `pageextension`, a `tableextension` and a
`report`, each with the var placed AFTER the kind's structural sections.

**Result (2026-07-27, `alc 17.0.29.44223`, platform/application 28.0.0.0, runtime 17.0):**
exit 0, zero errors, artifact produced. All four kinds accept the declaration.

So the stated reason is wrong. The real constraint is anchor POSITION within the object — the
same thing R38 turned out to be for codeunits, where the var had to follow the object's
properties. Recovering the 41% is anchor work plus operator coverage of those bodies, not a
language limitation.

Re-run:

```sh
alc /project:<this dir's parent copy> /packagecachepath:<symbols> /out:probe.app
```

Note the probe compiles only; it does not prove the guard EXECUTES correctly in those kinds, which
is a separate live question.
